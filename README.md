# Arabic-RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-
Arabic RAG is an end-to-end system for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tailored for Arabic documents. It extracts textual and visual information from PDFs, preprocesses and encodes them using the CLIP model, stores embeddings in a vector database, and supports real-time question answering over the ingested content.
